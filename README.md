# Unorthodox-Expert-System
An Unorthodox Expert System based on a different interpretation of the Karnaugh Map.

See the index.html file for general ideas, the code does not follow it exactly.

Run under Rust, a command help screen will display.  

Simply pressing the Enter key and seeing what happens is all you need to do.

The program is an expert of its own state.  Various (canned) actions change the state and the program
gets a progressively better understanding of what the actions do.  The program seeks samples to 
improve its understanding.

A final, exact, understanding is NOT the goal, just as there is still a lot that I do not understand.

The goal is a better and better understanding, due to samples gathered by circumstance and intention.
