//! The Pn enum. Pn stands for Pattern Number, with values of One, Two (order matters) or Unpredictable.
//!
//! Squares with the same Pn value may be combinable into a group.
//!
//! For Pn::One squares, their RuleStores should be compatible for a union.
//! There should be no squares inbetween that are not Pn::One.
//! Squares inbetween should have a rule that is a subset of the combined rules.
//!
//! For Pn::Two squares, their RuleStores should be compatible for a union.
//! There should be no squares inbetween that are Pn::Unpredictable.
//! There should be no squares inbetween that are Pn::One, with more than one sample,
//! as that indicates not-Pn::Two, since order matters.
//! Squares inbetween with one sample should have a rule that is a subset of one
//! of the combined rules.
//! Squares inbetween that are Pn::Two, must have rules that are a subset of the combined rules.
//!
//! For Pn::Unpredictable squares, there should be no squares
//! inbetween that have filled the maximum results (4),
//! (referred to as pnc, or pattern number confirmed)
//! with a Pn other than Unpredictable.
//!
//! Repeated sampling can cause the Pn value to change back and forth, its contingent.
//! Just like a ball drops when you let go of it, until is doesn't.
//!
